                 "assist you in creating a draft by offering ideas, suggestions, and jogging your memory regarding " \
                 "events, personalities, and other details that may have slipped into the recesses of your mind over " \
                 "time. To facilitate this process, we have developed a comprehensive questionnaire that will help " \
                 "organize and activate your memories.\n\nWe recommend that you begin by reviewing the Questionnaire " \
                 "and " \
                 "gaining a general understanding of the history you wish to recount, including its elements and the " \
                 "desired sequence of presentation. Naturally, this initial plan can be refined as you remember or " \
                 "uncover additional items for your memoir. The Questionnaire screen can be accessed from any page by "\
                 "pressing the \"Questionnaire\" button, and you can return to the original screen by selecting " \
                 "\"Back.\"\n\nOnce you have drafted the first section of your document, such as the opening chapter, "\
                 "please press the \"Edit\" button. Our application will then pass it through an Artificial " \
                 "Intelligence System that will refine the organization and wording of your draft. The polished " \
                 "version will be displayed beneath the draft you entered.\n\nAt this stage, we recommend carefully " \
                 "reviewing both the pre-final document and the draft, making any necessary changes. Once you are " \
                 "satisfied with the pre-final draft, pressing the \"Final\" button will solidify it as the final " \
                 "version and move it to the file where the complete document is being assembled.\n\nWe are delighted "\
                 "to " \
                 "embark on this journey of preserving your personal history through the art of memoir writing. " \
                 "Should you have any questions or require further assistance, please don\'t hesitate to reach out. " \
                 "Happy writing!"
