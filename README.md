# TO DO's

- Add a home button to get back to the main page to the right of the next button
- Update Dashboard (Javier's email)
- For Questionnaires: Submit (Save) shouldn’t take you back to the home page,
  Just save and say “saved” when done
- When we are finished with a section we should have a page (where question 21 would be). It should say “ congratulations you have answered the questions to help us create your persona”.    Here are the questions and answers below.
- When complete: let’s test out your persona: “Write a one-page letter that I can email to a son or daughter having a challenge time sharing how I have dealt a hard challenge”
- Get rid of user_manag_sys app (It's doing nothing)
- Add Email Verification
- Add Google authentication
- [IMPORTANT] Add the option to generate multiple versions(passes) of the chapter (up to 4)
