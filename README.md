- [IMPORTANT] Free trial with fewer questions (Maybe 5?)
- When complete: let’s test out your persona: “Write a one-page letter that I can email to a son or daughter having a challenge time sharing how I have dealt a hard challenge”
- [IMPORTANT] Add the option to generate multiple versions(passes) of the chapter (up to 4)
- Add a button to log out
