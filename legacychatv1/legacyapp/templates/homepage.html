    <h1>Legacy Chat</h1>

    <h2>Preserving Family Wisdom</h2>
    <p>
        Thank you for choosing Legacy as your tool for writing your memoirs.
        Our primary objective is to assist you in creating a draft by offering ideas,
        suggestions, and jogging your memory regarding events, personalities,
        and other details that may have slipped into the recesses of your mind over time.
        To facilitate this process, we have developed a comprehensive questionnaire that will
        help organize and activate your memories.
    </p>
    <p>
        We recommend that you begin by reviewing the Questionnaire and gaining a general
        understanding of the history you wish to recount,
        including its elements and the desired sequence of presentation.
        Naturally, this initial plan can be refined as you remember or uncover additional items
        for your memoir. The Questionnaire screen can be accessed from any page
        by pressing the "Questionnaire" button, and you can return to the original screen
        by selecting "Back."
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you have drafted the first section of your document,
        such as the opening chapter, please press the "Edit" button.
        Our application will then pass it through an Artificial Intelligence System
         that will refine the organization and wording of your draft. The
         polished version will be displayed beneath the draft you entered.

    </p>
    <p>
        At this stage, we recommend carefully reviewing both the pre-final document and the draft,
         making any necessary changes. Once you are satisfied with the pre-final draft,
          pressing the "Final" button will solidify it as the final version and move it
           to the file where the complete document is being assembled.

    </p>
    <p>
        We are delighted to embark on this journey of preserving your personal history
         through the art of memoir writing. Should you have any questions or
         require further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out. Happy writing!
